# thunder-bow
Experimental Minecraft datapack

## Currently supported game versions:
**1.20.4**<br>

## What is it?
thunder-bow is my first Minecraft datapack, initially created in 2024 for a private server. It adds a custom bow that summons lightning where the arrow lands.

## Custom model replacement (optional) 
This datapack was made with a resource pack in mind. It adds a custom model for the bow. It's supposed to look like "thunder superpowers" (whatever that means).
The resource pack is included with the datapack
